# Emb(race): Policy and Legislation Reform

Technology has the power to drive action. And right now, a call to action is
needed to eradicate racism. **Black lives matter.**

We recognize technology alone cannot fix hundreds of years of racial injustice
and inequality, but when we put it in the hands of the Black community and
their supporters, technology can begin to bridge a gap. To start a dialogue.
To identify areas where technology can help pave a road to progress.

This project is an effort to utilize technology to analyze, inform, and
develop policy to reform the workplace, products, public safety, and
legislation.

This is one of three open source projects underway as part of the [Call for 
Code Emb(race) Spot Challenge](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code) 
led by contributors from IBM and Red Hat.

## Goal for this project

The desired outcome of this effort is an open source technology solution that 
can have a measurable impact on the problem statements and hills below. That 
solution can then be put to work within IBM and Red Hat, as well as society at 
large.

This repository is expected to evolve into a piece of technology that can
be created and deployed, similar to the steps for other [Call for Code starter
kits](https://github.com/Call-for-Code), such as the kit for [Community 
Cooperation](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020) 
or [Crisis 
Communications](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020).

## Problem statements

1. [Citizens don't have a straightforward way of knowing what or how policies
and regulations impact them](#problem-statement-1)
2. [Voting may be impossible or challenging due to burdensome local 
processes](#problem-statement-2)
3. [Citizens and lawmakers have difficulty identifying implicit 
bias](#problem-statement-3)

## Problem statement 1

Concerned and impacted citizens don't have a straightforward way of knowing
what or how policies and regulations impact them or what they can do in
response.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. Citizens are aware of policy that is being considered that is highly
impactful to them, without needing to follow every vote.

2. Citizens are able to understand the specific impact of proposed policy on
them without being a legal expert.

3. Citizens are able to share opinions so they can influence policy decisions
before they are finalized.

4. Citizens can easily ascertain the voting record themes or trend of their
elected officials and political candidates without prior knowledge of who
they are. (May overlap with group #3)

5. Policy makers have visibility into how diverse citizenry will be impacted
by multiple variations of a proposed policy.

## Problem statement 3

Citizens and lawmakers have difficulty identifying implicit bias within
current or proposed policies, which makes it difficult to assess potential
negative impacts of those new policies.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. Nonprofits and watchdogs can review policy implications so as to
prioritize items ahead of major policy decisions.

2. Voters can identify state/federal/local policies that show bias before
they are enacted or identify older policies that should be reformed.

3. Voters can identify lawmakers that have voted on policies that show bias
against a group.

#### Examples

* Cannot identify implicit Bias in following Laws
  * Crime Bill of 1994 - The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, H.R. 3355, Pub.L. 103–322 is an Act of Congress dealing with crime and
law enforcement - exacerbated mass incarceration
  * Stop and Frisk policy in New York (not legislation) - allowed police to
stop individuals with little cause, and as a result of institutional bias,
black and brown people were disproportionately targeted. Went against due
process and provided almost no cause for police to be able to stop and search
your person
  * Controlled Substance and Controlled Substance Import and Export Acts, the
provisions punishing the presence of a firearm in connection with a crime of
violence or drug trafficking offense - example of mandatory minimum sentencing
-meaning they have to sentence a minimum of certain years for certain crimes,
which can lead to over sentencing
* Mandatory minimum sentencing - unduly impacts black and brown people for
'minor' offenses
* Charge stacking - even if you are cleared of one charge, other minor
charges can affect the time you receive
